# Developer Best Practices

Start each session with a pull request from main to ensure than you are working with the lastest verison of the code.
- git pull origin main
Always work on your named branch.
Push changes to dev branch.
Resolve merging issues on dev branch.
Make sure that everything works on dev branch.
THEN push to main.
